        "Q.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. It aims to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program, making code more structured, reusable, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Core Concepts (The Four Pillars of OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It promotes data hiding by restricting direct access to an object's internal state, and instead provides controlled access through public methods (like getter and setter methods). This enhances data security and integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on simplifying complex systems by presenting only essential features and hiding unnecessary implementation details from the user. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, improving code readability and manageability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This mechanism allows a new class (child or derived class) to inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent or base class). Inheritance promotes code reusability, reduces redundancy, and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Meaning \"many forms,\" polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class, allowing a single interface to be used for a general class of actions. This is achieved through methods like method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism), where the same method name can perform different tasks based on the object or context"

        "Q.24- What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique that allows for the sequential invocation of multiple methods on the same object within a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method in the chain return the object itself (typically self) after performing its action."

        "Q.25- What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method in Python allows instances of a class to be invoked or called as if they were regular functions. When this method is defined within a class, calling an object of that class (e.g., my_object()) automatically triggers the execution of the __call__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary purposes and benefits of using the __call__ method include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating Callable Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "It enables objects to behave like functions, allowing for more flexible and reusable code. This is particularly useful when an object needs to encapsulate both data and a specific operation that can be directly invoked.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing Decorators:\n",
        "\n",
        "__call__ is frequently used in implementing class-based decorators, where the decorator itself is an instance of a class that modifies the behavior of a function or method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Function Factories:\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be used to create \"function factories,\" where an object generates and returns functions with specific behaviors based on internal state or parameters passed during the object's creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintaining State in Callable Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike simple functions, callable objects can maintain state between calls, which can be advantageous in scenarios requiring persistent data or complex internal logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulating Functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows for the encapsulation of functionality within an object, promoting organized and maintainable code by combining data and the operations that act upon it."
